**To use the pre-trained model**
1. Download the **final_proj_try2.h5** file.
2. load the model using the function **load_model('path of final_proj.try2.h5 file')** 
for more info [link to youtube!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n1SpeudvAE&feature=youtu.be)

**The zip file for the Dataset used for training the model is** *"new_dataset.zip"* 
The dataset is spilt into 3 parts Train, Test, Val.

**seg_test.zip** contains the images obtained after segmentation, which are used for prediction.


* The code for creating and training the model can be found in **final_proj_try2.ipynb**
* The code for creating augmented training dataset can be found in **aug_Data_gen.ipynb**
